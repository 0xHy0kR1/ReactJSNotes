# Introduction 
- In React, we create our app by dividing it into different components.
- We can create components of our app individually and can reuse them again and again.
- **For Example:** In the below image, we have structured our app into the header, footer, body, and                     right navigation bar.

# Advantage of dividing our app into components:
- By dividing your app into components, you can reuse the component in the same or different app repeatedly.
- It also makes it easier to find errors in a large set of your code.
