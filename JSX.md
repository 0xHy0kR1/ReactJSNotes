## Introduction
- It stands for Javascript XML.
- It is the syntax extension of Javascript which allows HTML to co-exist with Javascript in React.

## Why JSX is created?
- By allowing developers to write HTML like code directly in their JavaScript files, JSX makes it easier and faster to build user interfaces. 

## Some points to remember while using JSX:
- You have to write "className" instead of "class" as class is the reserved keyword in Javascript.
- In place of "for" you have to use "htmlFor"

## JSX fragment feature:
- With return() we can return only one tag or Element. 
- If you want to return two elements using JSX you have to use the JSX Fragment Feature or wrap the whole content in one element. 
- For example, if we want to return the content of the "h1" tag and "div" tag together we will be using a JSX fragment(<>........</>).
